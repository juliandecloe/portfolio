                        <p>Isn't space awesome? Well I think it is. That is why, during a school project, I made a
                            multiplayer game where you can fly in space with your own rocket and discover planets.
                            Using <a href="https://socket.io/docs/v4/#what-socketio-is" target="_blank">web sockets</a>
                            I
                            made it so
                            that multiple users can join and see eachother fly. The solar system in this game is a real

                        <p>My goal for this school project was to create a "Netflix alike" website where people can
                            discover
                            all the art form
                            the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Sadly I wasn't finished, so it turned into a simple art
                            discovery
                            site. This project

                        <p>A website should be available for everyone. Even if the css and javascript is turned off,
                            people
                            should be able to still
                            see the content. That is what this school project is about. Creating a website compatible
                            for
                            every browser and every user.
                            This project also gave me the opportunity to play around with submitting forms to a JSON
                            file
                            and giving it back to every client.

                            (any form of Javascript was restricted). It is called 'The Anticlimax Fireworkshow' because
                            I
                            didn't have time to make a lot
                            of different fireworks. Everything on this little webpage is made out of HTML elements and

                            styling.

                        <h3>Git Tournaments</h3>
                        <p>Github is a platform where developers can place and update their websites. For a school
                            project
                            during the minor Web Development I created a leaderboard based on github. This leaderboard
                            is based on the github forks of the minor. Through the leaderboard you can see who has the
                            most
                            commits (updates),
                            most stars (rates) and most repositories (projects). Through this app I want to motivate the
                            students
                            to use Github better and more often.

            <div>
                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>My name is Julian de Cloe. I live in Haarlem, a city located in the Netherlands. I am 20 years old 
                    and in my last year of college. Right now I'm studying Communication and Multimedia Design at the Hogeschool 
                    van Amsterdam (HvA). This is a full time bachelor which lasts 4 years. During this study I found out that my passion lays with web development. This is a 
                    smaller branch within the bachelor. Even though I chose web development, I still had 2 years of college studying UX design, so you can 
                    say that I am also capable of UX research and design.
                </p>
                <h3>What I like about web development</h3>
                <p>I started back in 2019 with HTML and CSS. I quickly started to get the hang of it which made it immediately more 
                    fun to do. In the beginning of 2020 I learned how to use javascript (note that this was all front end development). My teacher was amazed about
                    the fact that I learned it so quickly that the next year he offered me a job to tutor freshmen in javascript. I did this for three classes. I also 
                    did some sideprojects for fun and started coding in school projects where you didn't even have to code. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    A year later I chose the minor Web Development. This is where I also started programming back end using Javascript. It is still the basics, because 
                    there is still so much more to learn an accomplish. The thing I like about back end is that it keeps you busy. There are a lot more brain teasers in the back end
                    then in front end. But if I have to chose between front and back end, I would chose front end. Front end is more creative than back end. I still have 
                    a lot of creativity left in me that I want to express.
                </p>
